    "name": "54_Mock_OpenAI_API_Response_Analyzer_App",
    "query": "I want to create an app that will enable me to analyze the different responses the OpenAI API may give for the same query. The frontend should be implemented in `src/frontend.py` and should contain a conversation between a user and an LLM as a list. Each list item should contain a text field where I can add a (potentially large) text message and a dropdown that selects if the message is from the LLM or the user. This functionality should be handled in `src/message_list.py`. There can be an unbounded number of these list items, so when the app loads, it should start with a single empty list item, and there should be a button to add new list items as needed. Other than the list, there should be a numeric field, implemented in `src/frontend.py`, that the user can edit. This field should only allow values from 0 to 100. There should also be a button labelled SUBMIT. When I click on the SUBMIT button, the full conversation should be sent to the OpenAI API in parallel X number of times, where X is the value of the 0 to 100 number that the user entered on the frontend. All API requests and responses should be handled in `src/backend.py`. When the responses are fetched from the OpenAI API, they should be displayed as a list of expandable elements in `src/frontend_render.py`. For example, if I set the number of requests to 10, when the responses start coming, 10 elements should appear, each labelled with the request number. When expanded, they should show that specific response. Keep in mind that the OpenAI API returns a stream, so the responses should stream to the frontend token-by-token and be displayed in real time. This functionality should be implemented in `src/stream_handler.py`. Use Tailwind for styling in `src/styles.css`, but don\u2019t install it. Instead, use the CDN version. You should use mock LLM's responses to alleviate OpenAI key usage. Mock LLM responses should be generated in `src/mock_llm.py`.",
