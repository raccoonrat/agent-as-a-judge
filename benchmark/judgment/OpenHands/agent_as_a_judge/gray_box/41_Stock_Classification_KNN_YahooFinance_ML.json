    "query": "Develop a stock classification system using a KNN model on the Yahoo Finance dataset. Your implementation should decide if a given stock will increase or decrease in price. Start by loading the dataset and performing feature engineering, including generating technical indicators and selecting the most relevant features in `src/data_loader.py`. Standardize the data to ensure feature values are within the same range in `src/data_loader.py`. Apply the KNN classifier to classify stocks based on the engineered features, and save the implementation in `src/model.py`. Next, save the classification results to `results/classification_results.txt`, and visualize the correlation between the technical indicators and the classification result as a heatmap using seaborn. Save the headmap as `results/figures/feature_correlation_heatmap.png`. Finally, create an interactive Jupyter Notebook under `results/` that explains the process, showcases the classification results, and will help ease future updates that introduce new data.",
