    "query": "Hey! Could you help me build a text classification system using a pretrained BERT model on the AG News dataset? Start by loading and preprocessing the data in `src/data_loader.py` (including removing whatever noise you can and performing tokenization). Once that's done, please save the BERT model parameters under `models/saved_models/`. Apply the BERT model and save the classification results to `results/results.txt`. Also, visualize the confusion matrix using seaborn and save it as `results/figures/confusion_matrix.png`. Finally, create an interactive Jupyter Notebook to display the input texts alongside their classification results under `results/`. It would be great if the notebook explained how transfer learning was used and its impact on the model's performance. Likewise, it would be good if your implementation is straightforward to swap out the dataset, including the code to retrain BERT. Thanks a bunch!",
