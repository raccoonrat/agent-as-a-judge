    "query": "Please implement a Naive Bayes classifier for the 20 Newsgroups dataset and save it in a file called `src/model.py`. The dataset should loaded in `src/data_loader.py`. The program should handle data preprocessing, including removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Show the improvement of your classifier by generating word clouds before and after training your classifier and saving them as `results/figures/wordcloud_before.png` and `results/figures/wordcloud_after.png`. Please calculate and include TF-IDF features when loading the data in `src/data_loader.py`. Lastly, print out a performance report (including precision, recall, and F1-score) and save it as `results/metrics/performance.txt`. The model should be straightforward to interpret, and the final report should be structured clearly for easy review.",
