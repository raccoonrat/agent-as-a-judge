    "query": "Build a wine quality prediction system using a Decision Tree model with the Wine Quality dataset from UCI. Preprocess the data in `src/data_loader.py`, including handling missing values and feature scaling. Use cross-validation to evaluate the model in `src/train.py`. Implement the Decision Tree regression model in `src/model.py`.Save the mean squared error in `results/metrics/mean_squared_error.txt`. Visualize and save feature importance as `results/figures/feature_importance.png`. Create a Jupyter Notebook with results and visualizations, and summarize your observations. The Notebook should thoroughly document the preprocessing steps to ensure reproducibility. Convert the Notebook to a PDF report and save it as `results/report.pdf`. The PDF report should also include a brief discussion on potential improvements of the model.",
