    "query": "Could you help me create a project for breast cancer prediction using an SVM model with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset? Load the dataset and perform feature selection to identify important features in `src/data_loader.py`. Implement the SVM classifier for cancer prediction in `src/model.py`. Use cross-validation to evaluate the model in `src/train.py`. Save the confusion matrix as `results/figures/confusion_matrix.png`. Put together a detailed report that documents the entire process-from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The report should cover the feature selection process and include a clear heatmap of the performance metrics. Save the report as `results/metrics/breast_cancer_prediction_report.pdf`.",
