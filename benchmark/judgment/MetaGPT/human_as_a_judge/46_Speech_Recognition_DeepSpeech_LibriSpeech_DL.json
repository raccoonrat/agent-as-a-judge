    "query": "I'd like to develop a speech recognition system using the DeepSpeech library and the LibriSpeech dataset for me. Could you implement data loading and audio preprocessing, including noise reduction and normalization, in `src/data_loader.py`? Tune the hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size in `src/train.py`. Please save the recognition results in `results/recognition_results.txt`. Next, create visualizations of the audio processing stages (like waveform and spectrogram) and save them as `results/figures/audio_visualization.png`. Generate a detailed report on recognition accuracy, error analysis, and suggestions for future improvements, and save it as `results/recognition_report.md`. Additionally, document the setup process for DeepSpeech, with tips for common installation issues, with [DeepSpeech documentation](https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/r0.9/) as a reference. Save the final model in `models/saved_models/`. Thanks in advance!",
