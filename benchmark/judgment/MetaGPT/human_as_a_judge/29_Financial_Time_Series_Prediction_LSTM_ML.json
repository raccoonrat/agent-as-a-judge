    "query": "Could you help me set up a financial time series prediction system using an LSTM model with some real-world Financial Analysis, like stock prices or Bitcoin prices? First, we'll need to clean the data, taking care of any missing values and outliers in `src/data_loader.py`. Then, let's convert the time series data into a supervised learning format using a time window in `src/data_loader.py`. Finally apply a LSTM model for prediction, where the LSTM model is implemented in `src/model.py`. Once you've got the predictions, save the results as `results/prediction_results.text`. Create an interactive dashboard visualizing prediction results using Dash and save the implementation in `src/dashboard.py`. Finally, I'd appreciate a Markdown document that shows the model architecture, training process, and performance analysis, saved as `results/report.md`. Make sure the system manages the start and stop of the Dash app automatically to save resources. Thanks so much!",
