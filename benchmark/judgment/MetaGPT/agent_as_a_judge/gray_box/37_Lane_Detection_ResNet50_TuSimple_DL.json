    "query": "Develop a lane detection system. Start by importing the standard pre-trained ResNet-50 model from PyTorch in `src/model.py`. We'll work here with the TuSimple lane detection dataset as our test dataset, which should be loaded through `src/data_loader.py`. Then load and preprocess the dataset, including data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, rotation, and scaling in `src/data_loader.py`. Fine-tune the model and save the detection accuracy in `results/metrics/detection_accuracy.txt`, and save the trained model as `models/saved_models/lane_detection_model.pth`. Split a subset of the data for validation, implemented in `src/data_loader.py`. Visualize detection results using matplotlib and save them to `results/figures/`. Create a detailed report of the entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and save it as `results/lane_detection_report.pdf`. The report should also analyze the model's performance under challenging conditions such as curves or poor lighting.",
