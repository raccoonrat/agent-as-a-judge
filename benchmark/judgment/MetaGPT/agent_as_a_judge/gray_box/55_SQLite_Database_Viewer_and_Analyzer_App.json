    "name": "55_SQLite_Database_Viewer_and_Analyzer_App",
    "query": "I want to create an app that enables users to view and analyze AI development data stored in an SQLite database. On the frontend (implemented in `src/frontend.py`), the user should either upload a new SQLite database, including AI model training logs or prompt-response data, by selecting a file from their device or select a previously uploaded database cached in `src/cache.py`. This way, the user won't need to upload the database every time they want to analyze it. If a new database is uploaded, they can name it, and the file will be sent to the backend (`src/backend.py`) and stored for future use. Once the database is uploaded, users can interact with it. The user should see a list of AI models or apps from an `app` table. They should be able to select one app, and view its development tasks from a `development_planning` table. After selecting a task, they can view all development steps associated with it. Finally, selecting a step will display detailed data such as `prompt_path`, `messages`, `llm_response`, and `prompt_data`, with the appropriate information rendered on the frontend (in `src/frontend_render.py`).\nThe SQLite database will always follow this structure: the `app` table contains all apps stored in the database. Each app has multiple development tasks stored as an array in the `development_planning` table under the key `development_plan`. Each array item is a JSON object with three key-value pairs: `description`, `user_review_goal`, and `programming_goal`. Each development task contains many development steps, which are stored in the `development_steps` table and linked to the `app` table using the `app_id` field.\nThe challenge is that there is no direct connection between the development task and the development step. Therefore, in `src/backend_logic.py`, all development steps need to be retrieved and then split by the `prompt_path` field. Every development task begins with the `prompt_path` value `development/task/breakdown.prompt`, so the development steps can be grouped by splitting the list of steps into smaller lists, where each begins with the step that has `prompt_path` equal to `development/task/breakdown.prompt`. This will give the correct set of development steps for each task.\nEach development step contains the following values, which need to be displayed on the frontend (`src/frontend_render.py`):\n- `prompt_path`: a string.\n- `messages`: an array of JSON objects.\n- `llm_response`: a JSON object.\n- `prompt_data`: a JSON object.\nThe `messages` array will always have JSON objects with the keys `content` and `role`. The frontend should display the `content` in a large text field, with the `role` shown as a label. The `llm_response` object will always have a `text` key, which should be displayed as a text area to show potentially long strings. The `prompt_data` object may have various key-value pairs, and each should be displayed to the user in an appropriate format.",
