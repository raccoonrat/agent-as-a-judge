    "query": "I am seeking a speech emotion recognition project using a CNN-LSTM model with the RAVDESS dataset, which should be downloaded from Kaggle or [this Hugging Face link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xbgoose/ravdess). The project should load the dataset and perform robust audio preprocessing (noise removal and normalization) and MFCC feature extraction, implemented in `src/data_loader.py`. The CNN-LSTM model should be implemented in 'src/model.py'. Recognition accuracy should be saved in `results/metrics/recognition_accuracy.txt`, and a confusion matrix should be generated and saved as `results/figures/confusion_matrix.png`. Additionally, a user-friendly local API should be created using Flask to allow users to upload audio files and receive emotion recognition results, with the implementation included in `src/hci.py`.",
