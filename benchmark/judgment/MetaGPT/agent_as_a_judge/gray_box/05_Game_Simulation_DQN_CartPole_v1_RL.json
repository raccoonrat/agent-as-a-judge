    "query": "Create a reliable system to train a DQN agent using PyTorch in an OpenAI Gym environment such as CartPole-v1. Implement DQN using PyTorch in `src/model.py`. The environment should be instantiated in the main file, `src/main.py`. Handle any dimension mismatches between DQN and the environment (like would happen if the Gym environment ID were changed) by logging an error. Also please log the return after each episode to `results/metrics/` and update it after each new episode finishes. Save the final return over episode curve as `results/figures/return_over_time.png` and the final trained model as `models/saved_models/dqn_model.pt`. If possible, add annotations to the return over episode curve to showcase key milestones.",
