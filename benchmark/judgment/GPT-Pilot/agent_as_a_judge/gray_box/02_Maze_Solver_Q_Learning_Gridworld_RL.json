    "query": "Can you help me create a system to solve maze-style Gridworld tasks using the Q-learning algorithm? The system should use numpy to make the core calculations more efficient and matplotlib for visualizations. The Q-learning algorithm should be implemented in `src/train.py`, and the aptly-named Gridworld environment should be implemented in `src/env.py` in such a way that one could specific the grid size and start/end positions when instantiating it. The system needs to record the learning curve during training, tracking episodes and their corresponding returns, and save it as `results/figures/learning_curve.png`. Additionally, I'd like you to visualize and save the paths taken by the agent in each episode in a file called `results/figures/path_changes.gif`, and save the trained model as `models/saved_models/q_learning_model.npy`. It would be great to have some form of real-time feedback during training, like seeing the progress or getting updates on how the model is learning. Also, if you can, please try and write the code in a way that's easy to modify or extend later on.",
