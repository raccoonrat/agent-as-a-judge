    "query": "Could you help me set up a product recommendation system using a matrix factorization algorithm with the Electronics subset of the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset? You should handle data loading and all the data preprocessing, including noise removal and normalization in `src/data_loader.py`. Apply a latent factor model to compute user-item interactions and save the implementation in `src/model.py`. Print and save the recommendation results to `results/recommendation_results.txt`. Then visualize these recommendations using the Plotly library and save the visualization as `results/figures/recommendation_visualization.html`. Finally, generate an analysis report covering data preprocessing, model training, and results, should be saved as `results/recommendation_report.md`.",
