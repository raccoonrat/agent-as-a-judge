    "query": "Create a medical image classification system using a pre-trained DenseNet-121 model and the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset. Start by loading and preprocessing the dataset and performing data augmentation (including rotation, translation, and scaling) in `src/data_loader.py`. Apply the DenseNet-121 model for classification, recording the accuracy and saving it to `results/metrics/classification_accuracy.txt`. Fine-tune the model and save it as `models/saved_models/chest_xray_densenet_model.pth`. Use Grad-CAM to visualize the model's decision-making process and save these visualizations as `results/figures/grad_cam_visualizations.gif`. Finally, create a Markdown report that documents the model architecture, training process, data augmentation techniques, and analysis of the results, and save it as `results/medical_image_classification_report.md`. It would also be nice if the system was flexible such that the DenseNet-121 could be easily further fine-tuned by a human user.",
