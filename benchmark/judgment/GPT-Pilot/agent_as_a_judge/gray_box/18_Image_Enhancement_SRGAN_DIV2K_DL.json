    "query": "I need to create a system for image enhancement using an SRGAN model (you can obtain a pre-trained SRGAN [here](https://github.com/tensorlayer/srgan)) with the DIV2K dataset, which can be downloaded from [this link](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/). The dataset should be loaded in the `src/data_loader.py` file. The system should preprocess the images, including resizing and normalization, in `src/data_loader.py`. Use a pre-trained model saved under `models/saved_models/` to save time, and save the enhanced images to the `results/figures/` directory. Additionally, the system should visualize and save the comparison between the original and enhanced images to `results/figures/enhanced_comparison.png`. Finally, create a Markdown report with results and visualizations on a diverse set of samples to showcase the model's performance on various types of images, and save it as `results/report.md`. The report should include a detailed comparison of the model's performance on these selected samples, highlighting where the model excels or struggles.",
