    "query": "I need to create a system for image generation using a DCGAN model with the MNIST`dataset. Load the MNIST dataset in `src/data_loader.py` and implement the DCGAN model in `src/model.py`. The system should ensure the use of the correct DCGAN architecture, save the generated images to `results/figures/`, monitor the model training by recording training loss under `results/metrics/` and generated images under `results/figures/`, and performe a hyperparameter search on the generation parameters such as noise vector dimensions and learning rate in `src/train.py` to improve performance. Additionally, create and save a GIF animation of the generated images to `results/figures/generated_images.gif`, present the training process and results in a well-structured Jupyter Notebook, and convert the Notebook into a polished PDF report saved as `results/training_report.pdf`. The DCGAN model architecture should be clearly documented in the Notebook to avoid confusion with other GAN variants.",
