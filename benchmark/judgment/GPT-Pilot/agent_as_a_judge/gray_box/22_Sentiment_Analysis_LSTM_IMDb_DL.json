    "query": "Could you help me set up a sentiment analysis project using an LSTM model and the IMDb dataset? Please implement data cleaning in `src/data_loader.py`, including the removal of stop words and punctuation. Use word embeddings to convert the text to a numerical format and save these embeddings under `models/saved_models/`. Then use these embeddings as input of an LSTM model, which should be implemented in `src/model.py`. Save the classification report to `results/metrics/classification_report.txt`. Create a Jupyter Notebook saved as `results/report.ipynb` with the model architecture and training process visualized. Also, save the training loss and accuracy curves to `results/figures/training_curves.png`. Pre-trained embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) are preferred to enhance model performance.",
