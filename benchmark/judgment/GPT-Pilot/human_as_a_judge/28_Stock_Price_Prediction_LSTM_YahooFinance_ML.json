    "query": "Could you help me build a stock price prediction system using an LSTM model and the Yahoo Finance dataset? Please clean the data, including handling missing values and outliers, and use a time window to convert the time series data to a supervised learning problem. The LSTM model should be implemented in `src/model.py`, and the dataset loading, cleaning, and conversion should be implemented in `src/data_loader.py`. Save the prediction results to `results/predictions.txt` and generate and save interactive charts of the prediction results in `results/figures/prediction_interactive.html` using Plotly. Create a Jupyter Notebook with model architecture visualization, training process, and prediction results and save it as a PDF report at `results/report.pdf`.",
